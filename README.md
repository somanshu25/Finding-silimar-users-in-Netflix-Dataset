# Findsing-silimar-users-in-Netflix-Dataset

The motive is to find the similar users who have rated highly almost same movies. The given databse is a Netflix userbase with movies , user_id, the rating of the movie and the date when the user rated.   

In this project, we are cleaning up the Netflix database to process the data easily according to the movies rated by the suers and then find the similar users who have rated the similar movies and list all those pairs. The project is further extended to identify the closest neighbor for a new user entered as recommendation.
